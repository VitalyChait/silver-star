# Silver Star: Job Board Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Silver Star project, a job board platform focused on connecting senior professionals with meaningful employment opportunities.

## Phase 1: Discovery and Planning - @Coco & @Jacqueline

This phase focuses on understanding target users and competitors to define a unique value proposition.

### Step 1.1: Identify Your Niche - @Coco & @Jacqueline

Since the senior job market is large, narrow your focus to increase the chances of success.

* **Geographic focus:** Target a specific city, state, or region.
* **Industry focus:** Concentrate on specific sectors, such as non-profit work, consulting, or roles for skilled tradespeople.
* **Job type focus:** Specialize in roles such as part-time, remote, or gig economy positions that are often more accessible to older adults.

### Step 1.2: Research Your Competition - @Coco & @Jacqueline

Analyze existing platforms to see what they offer and identify gaps in their services.

* **Established sites:** Review / Call large-scale sites like the **AARP Job Board**, **Indeed**, and **LinkedIn**, noting how they handle older workers.
***Ask questions, gather info, interview prep, career coaching***
* **Niche platforms:** Investigate specialized sites like **Workforce50.com**, **craiglist**, and **Seniors4Hire** to understand their specific features and content.

### Step 1.3: Define Your Value Proposition - @Coco & @Jacqueline

Determine what will make your service stand out.

* **Targeted content:** Offer resources tailored for older job seekers, such as resume templates that highlight experience rather than employment dates, and advice on combating age bias.
* **User-friendly design:** Build an accessible, easy-to-use interface, as your audience may be less tech-savvy than younger workers.
* **Curated jobs:** Ensure all job listings are from employers who have publicly committed to hiring older workers or have flexible roles.
* **Community features:** Include forums or virtual networking events to connect job seekers with each other and potential employers.


* ***Question:***: Should the UI be created by the non-technical team members with the help of the technical members on specific issues?
