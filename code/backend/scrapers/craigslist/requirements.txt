# Your existing modules rely on crewai & pydantic v1 style BaseModel imports. The provided code uses pydantic v2,
# but crewai.BaseTool still works with pydantic v2 via compatibility.
# If you run into version issues with crewai, pin:
crewai==0.51.1
#pydantic==1.10.15
# And update imports accordingly.
